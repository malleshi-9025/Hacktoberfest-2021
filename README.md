# Hacktoberfest-2021

## How can you contribute ?

This is a beginner friendly repo. 
It would be good if you have a basic knowledge about HTML.

### Step 1:
Click on the file named ```index.html```

### Step 2:
Click on the edit icon on the top right ( _just before delete icon_ ). This will automatically fork this repo to your account.

### Step 3:
If you are editing this repo later, make sure that you __fetch upstream__ to stay updated with the changes made in this repo. 

### Step 4:
Inside the html file, read the comments from lines 62 to 65 to get an idea of what you need to do. <br>
You can get your github profile picture's link by going to your profile, <br> right click on your dp and ```Open image in new tab``` <br>
Copy the link of the image and paste it in the code below where it says ```your github dp link here``` <br>
You can also use other arts, provided you place the correct link in the code. <br>
You will also need to copy your github profile link.

### Step 5:
Copy the code given below and paste in above the line saying <br>
```Add your card above this and leave a line after it``` <br>
Also don't forget to leave a space after your code, so as to make it easy for others.

``` [html]
<div class="card">
    <div class="dp">
        <img src="your github dp link here" alt="">
    </div>
    <div class="name">Your Name</div>
    <div class="sub">Programmer</div>
    <a class="btn" href="your github profile link here" target="_blank">View Profile</a>
